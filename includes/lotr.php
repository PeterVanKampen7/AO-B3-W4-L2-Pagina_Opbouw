    <h1>The Lord of the Rings</h1>
    <section id="left">
        <p>
            The all time classic of the fantasy genre, written by the godfather of fantasy JRR Tolkien. I cant properly describe
            my love for this trilogy and all its other books in the series. This is one of the very few books/series that I have read
            more than once, in fact I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy four times.
